# Springboard
- Meet Springboard. A simple boilerplate generator that boils down project setup time to mere seconds. ðŸš€
- Project to port the original app to Rust.

# Building
- To build crud-rs you will first need a working setup of `Rust` and `Cargo`. [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is the simplest way to set this up on either Windows, Mac or Linux.
- Once installed, to compile and run on your native platform is as simple as running the following in a terminal:

```
cargo run --release
```
